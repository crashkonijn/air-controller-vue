## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
The files that are compiled to the /dist folder should be placed in the `\WebGLTemplates\AirConsole` folder in Unity.

```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

### Build controller
 
You can edit the `src/App.vue` to build your controller in. 

(for now, the project you're working in and AirConsoleVue should be separated in the future)
